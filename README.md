# Overview

In order to expand my skills, I decided to keep exploring new languages, in this case with a Kotlin-based To-Do App. This application allows users to input tasks, add them to a list, mark them as done with a simple checkbox, and delete completed tasks. Through this project, my primary goal was to enhance my understanding of Kotlin's syntax and apply it to a practical scenario.

# Development Environment

To bring this To-Do App to life, I used the following development tools:

- **Kotlin:** The primary programming language used for this project, known for its concise syntax and interoperability with Java.
- **Android Studio:** If applicable, mention if you used Android Studio for any mobile components.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

- [Kotlin Official Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A valuable resource for troubleshooting and problem-solving.

# Future Work

While the To-Do App is functional, there are areas for improvement and features to be added in the future:

- Implement user authentication for personalized to-do lists.
- Enhance the user interface for improved organization such as categories.
- Explore database integration for persistent task storage.

These enhancements aim to elevate the To-Do App, making it more robust and user-friendly in future iterations.
